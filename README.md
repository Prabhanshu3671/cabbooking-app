A simple cab-booking backend application developed using Java Spring Boot framework integrated with MySQL database.

It contains APIs using which, users and drivers can register themselves along with their current locations in the platform.

Users can request for a list of cabs available within 5 units of their location by hitting another API.

Users can then pick a ride and book it from that list using another API.

The ride will update the location of both user and driver as per the destination.

Drivers can find their overall earnings of the day by calling a specific API.
